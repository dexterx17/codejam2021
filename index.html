                        . Arrays creator

Given two integers size and u, return the number of all the possible arrays of length size you can create using u different integers with the condition that no more than 2 elements are repeated one after another. The elements you use do not matter, just make sure they are different.

Example 1

Input:

size = 1, u = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

Here, u = 3 different elements were used: 1, 2, and 3. The arrays of length size = 1 are:

[1]
[2]
[3]

Example 2

Input:

size = 3, u = 3

Output: 24

Explanation:

The possible arrays are:

[1,1,2]    [2,2,1]    [3,3,1]
[1,1,3]    [2,2,3]    [3,3,2]
[1,2,2]    [2,1,1]    [3,1,1]
[1,2,3]    [2,1,3]    [3,1,2]
[1,3,2]    [2,3,1]    [3,2,1]
[1,3,3]    [2,3,3]    [3,2,2]
[1,2,1]    [2,1,2]    [3,1,3]
[1,3,1]    [2,3,2]    [3,2,3]

Note that the following arrays are not an option because the elements are repeated sequentially more than two times.

[1,1,1]
[2,2,2]
[3,3,3]

Constraints

    1 <= size <= 9
    1 <= u <= 10

Please enter the output for the following inputs:

                    <H3>Distancia minima</H3>
                    <p>
                        2. Maximum element with the minimum sum

Let numbers be an array of integers. Get the maximum element in the array that produces the smallest sum when adding all the elements that are different from itself.

Example 1:

Input:

numbers = [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5,6,6]

Output: 6

Explanation:

    For 1, the sum of the rest of elements different from itself is 2+3+3+3+3+4+5+6+6 = 35
    For 2, the sum is 34.
    For 3, the sum is 24.
    For 4, the sum is 32.
    For 5, the sum is 31.
    For 6, the sum is 24.

Both 3 and 6 produce the smallest sum (24), but 6 is greater than 3. Therefore, 6 is the maximum element that produces the smallest sum.

Also, consider that the numbers can be positive or negative.
